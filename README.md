<p style="text-align: justify;">
  
I am Enes, I graduated from Computer Programming and I am currently studying Management Information Systems. With my interest and knowledge in software development processes, I aim to interact with the community by sharing my projects on the GitHub platform. I hope to both improve myself and inspire others by sharing what I have learned and experienced in this process. You can follow my work on GitHub and we can discover learning opportunities together.

Best regards,
